# this runs on device with serial port, parse message from the host and respond to it

# protocol specification:
# H\n : hello message, send back hello and board name and programming language

# C\n : ask for available commands, send back available commands

# M+ModelName\n : set model name, send back model name
# M\n : ask for model name, send back model name

# D+DataName\n : set data name, send back data name
# D\n : ask for data name, send back data name

# S\n : start model, sned banck S when ready to start

# F\n : for device to send this when model is done only, not for host to send

# E\n Error, for device to send this when there is an error
# ">": device ready to receive command

# "R": reset the device, not implemented yet, TODO: implement this

# "A": if device is ready to receive command, send back ">"
